> **This fork (mustafzidan74/remote.futrx)** adds 23 features on top of upstream — trash & snapshots, share links & client portal, Telegram/WhatsApp/webhook notifications, audit log, project templates (WordPress pre-installed, Laravel, Node, Python), global skills, usage & cost dashboard, resource limits, autopilot & Playwright auto-test, playbooks & slash commands, secrets vault with SSH targets, voice input (Arabic), full-text chat search, command palette, health monitor, `/healthz` + heartbeat, and a full RTL/UX pass. See **[docs/whats-new.html](docs/whats-new.html)** (Arabic + English) and the per-feature docs under `docs/02-workspaces/`. Upstream PRs: futrx-com/remote.futrx#41–#48; the rest is offered as follow-ups.

## What is Remote?

Remote is an open-source, self-hosted home for AI coding agents.

Think of every project as its own server-side computer:

- It has a durable workspace, processes, ports, settings, and agent sessions.
- Codex, Claude Code, Kimi, and Antigravity can work in the same project without moving files between tools.
- The work keeps running on your server when you close your laptop.
- You can watch, review, edit, restart, or take over from any browser.

Remote is not another AI model. It gives the models you already use a complete place to work.

## What you get

- **One project computer per project** — an unprivileged LXC container with durable files and agent homes.
- **Your choice of agent** — use Codex, Claude Code, Kimi, or Antigravity with provider-specific model and reasoning controls.
- **A complete development surface** — chat, browser IDE, root terminal, files, uploads, Git history, and reusable skills.
- **Live applications** — Remote finds listening ports, creates project URLs, adds HTTPS, and shows the app beside the conversation.
- **A browser agents and humans can share** — let an agent browse visually, watch it work, or take over the same session.
- **Scheduled work** — let a project chat run a one-time or recurring prompt later, even when your browser is closed.
- **Controls outside the workspace** — manage access, secrets, CPU, memory, lifecycle, and recovery from the Remote host.

## How it works

```mermaid

    A["You<br>any browser"] --> B["Remote host<br>identity, routing, lifecycle"]
    B --> C["Project computer<br>one unprivileged LXC container"]
    C --> D["Codex · Claude · Kimi · Antigravity"]
    C --> E["IDE · terminal · Git · files"]
    C --> F["Browser · apps · HTTPS previews"]
```

The project computer is the capability boundary: agents can install tools, run servers, use Git, and browse inside it. The Remote host keeps authentication, routing, membership, and container lifecycle controls outside that boundary.

## Quick start

### What you need

- A fresh Ubuntu or Debian server
- Root or `sudo` access
- A hostname pointing at that server — one you own, or a free one
- A working SSH key
- Ports 80 and 443 open

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The installer disables SSH password login. Confirm that key-based SSH access works before you run it.

### 1. Point DNS to the server

Every project gets its own HTTPS address, so Remote needs a hostname with wildcard subdomains under it. Pick whichever case describes you — HTTPS is automatic in all three, with free Let's Encrypt certificates issued and renewed for you.

**If you already own a domain,** use a subdomain of it. For a base domain such as `remote.example.com`, create these records, all pointing at your server's IP address:

| DNS name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `remote.example.com` | Remote web app |
| `code.remote.example.com` | Browser IDE |
| `*.code.remote.example.com` | Per-project browser IDEs |
| `*.dev.remote.example.com` | Per-project application previews |

**If you want a free hostname,** [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org) is the quickest, because it resolves every subdomain automatically and there are no DNS records to create:

1. Sign in with GitHub or Google.
2. Add a name such as `yourname`. You now own `yourname.duckdns.org`.
3. Replace the pre-filled IP address with **your server's** address, then select **update ip**. The page fills in the address of the computer you are browsing from, which is usually not your server.

Then install using `yourname.duckdns.org` as the hostname.

[deSEC](https://desec.io) is a good alternative, run by a non-profit and less likely to be filtered on corporate networks. It is a full DNS host rather than a wildcard service, so create the four records from the table above under your `yourname.dedyn.io` name.

> [!NOTE]
> Free dynamic-DNS providers are community-run with no uptime guarantee, and some corporate networks block all of `*.duckdns.org` because of unrelated abuse elsewhere on it. If a preview link refuses to open at the office, that is usually why, and a domain you own avoids it.

**If you have neither,** a domain costs around $10 a year and gives you the shortest, most reliable URLs. Register one and follow the first case.

### 2. Install Remote

Connect to the server and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://remote.futrx.com/get | sudo bash -s -- remote.example.com
```

Replace `remote.example.com` with the hostname you set up above. The installer downloads Remote, installs its dependencies, builds the workspace image, starts the services, and enables HTTPS.

### 3. Create your first project

1. Visit `https://remote.example.com`.
2. Create the administrator account.
3. Open **Settings → Agents** and connect Codex, Claude Code, or Kimi.
4. Select **New project**.
5. Start a chat and describe what you want in normal language.

Remote will show the agent's progress. When the work is ready, review it in the chat, IDE, terminal, file manager, Git history, or live preview.

## Security in plain language

Remote is designed to reduce the blast radius of agent work, not to promise an air gap:

- Projects use separate unprivileged LXC containers, but they share the host kernel.
- The host administrator can access project data and controls.
- Secrets given to a project are readable by agents working in that project.
- Durable storage survives routine container replacement, but it is not a backup.

Before using Remote with valuable code or credentials, read the [threat model](docs/threat-model.md), [known limitations](docs/known-limitations.md), and [security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Updating

Run on the Remote server:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/remote.futrx/infra/update.sh
```

The updater rebuilds the app and project image while preserving project files and provider homes. Coordinate a maintenance window, or use `--skip-workspaces`, when agents are actively running. See [Deployment and operations](docs/04-operations/09-deployment-and-operations.md#update-flow) for details.
