// Which accounts asked for notifications in *this* browser.
//
// The browser's push subscription is not durable: a service restart, a deploy,
// or the push service rotating an endpoint can leave the device with nothing
// registered even though permission was never revoked. Remembering the opt-in
// locally is what lets the app restore the subscription silently instead of
// asking the user to allow notifications all over again.
//
// It is recorded per account because a browser subscription belongs to the
// whole origin: on a shared browser, one user's opt-in must never quietly turn
// notifications on for the next person who signs in.
//
// Accounts are stored as SHA-256 fingerprints, never as addresses: localStorage
// is readable by anyone with local access to the profile, and this list must
// not enumerate who has signed in here — the same reason the server hashes the
// filenames in its push-subscription store.
//
// Leaf service: it owns one list in the browser's store and knows nothing about
// subscriptions, the server, or who is signed in.
