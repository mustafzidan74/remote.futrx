// Package agentquota remembers the last subscription-quota reading each agent
// CLI volunteered, so the dashboard can show how much of a plan is left.
//
// The whole package exists because this number cannot be asked for. Claude and
// Codex each mention their rolling windows in the middle of a run and offer no
// endpoint, so the platform's only move is to notice what goes past and keep
// it. Two consequences shape everything here:
//
//   - A reading is a snapshot, not a live figure. Every reading carries when
//     it was taken and the UI is expected to say so; a stale number presented
//     as current is worse than an empty card, because an operator would plan
//     around it.
//   - An agent nobody has run has no reading at all, and that is not an error.
//     It is the honest state, and it is different from "0% used".
//
// It is also not the usage ledger. The ledger knows what this platform spent;
// the plan is spent from everywhere the operator works. Only the vendor knows
// the total, and these events are the vendor talking.
