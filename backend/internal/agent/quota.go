// Subscription quota, as the agent CLIs report it.
//
// This is the operator's *plan* allowance — the rolling window a Claude Max or
// ChatGPT subscription resets on — and it is a different number from anything
// the platform can compute itself. The usage ledger knows what this platform
// spent; the plan is spent from everywhere the operator works, including their
// laptop, so only the vendor can say how much is left.
//
// Both CLIs volunteer it mid-run and neither offers a way to ask:
//
//   - claude emits a top-level {"type":"rate_limit_event"} line carrying one
//     window at a time — "five_hour" or "seven_day" — with an absolute reset
//     time and a status.
//   - codex reports rate_limits inside its token_count event, as a primary and
//     a secondary window, each with a percentage used and a window length in
//     minutes.
//
// Neither is a request this platform can make, so a window is only as fresh as
// the last run that touched it. Anything built on this must say when it was
// measured rather than implying it is live.

// QuotaWindow names a rolling allowance. The two CLIs use different vocabulary
// for the same two shapes, and this is the platform's.
