# Application guide

This documentation maps the complete `remote.futrx` application: how to use every product surface, why it is designed around project-scoped agent computers, who can use each capability, and how requests move through the system.

## Scope notes

- The User Guide describes the current UI and calls out source-vs-demo discrepancies rather than promoting features that are no longer implemented.
- Product screenshots are authentic captures from the July 22, 2026 walkthrough; diagrams explain behavior that a still image cannot prove.
- The browser UI is Preact, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind.
- The backend is one Go process serving the API, WebSockets, and embedded frontend.
- Project execution happens in LXD containers; the durable workspace and provider homes live on the host and are bind-mounted into each container.
- Metadata uses JSON and JSONL files rather than a database.
