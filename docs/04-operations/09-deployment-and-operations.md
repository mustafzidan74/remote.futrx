# Deployment and operations

The supported deployment is a root-managed Ubuntu or Debian server with DNS pointing to the host, ports 80 and 443 open, and working SSH key access.

## Installation flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["Run infra/install.sh with hostname"] --> Validate["Validate root, distro, DNS, and options"]
    Validate --> Deps["Install pinned host dependencies"]
    Deps --> Build["Clone or update repo; build frontend and Go backend"]
    Build --> Proxy["Render, validate, and reload Caddy"]
    Proxy --> Service["Install and start systemd backend service"]
    Service --> Health["Poll backend health for up to 30 seconds"]
    Health --> Image["Build reusable LXD workspace image"]
    Image --> SSH["Disable SSH password authentication"]
    SSH --> Heal["Enable minutely LXD IPv4 repair timer"]
    Heal --> Ready["Open app and claim administrator"]
```

The curl bootstrap installs Git if needed, clones into `/opt/remote.futrx`, and re-executes the checked-out installer.

## Installed components

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/opt/remote.futrx` | Application checkout, built binary, frontend assets, infrastructure scripts, and data |
| `remote.futrx.service` | Go backend on loopback port `7682` by default |
| Caddy | Public HTTPS, compression, authentication, and proxy routing |
| LXD | Project-container runtime and base-image store |
| `futrx-remote-dev-base` | Reusable Ubuntu workspace image |
| `.lxd` DNS integration | Resolves container names through the LXD bridge |
| `lxc-ipv4-heal.timer` | Repairs running containers that lose IPv4 |
| code-server launcher PWA | One installable entry point for project IDEs |

## Build flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Frontend["Preact and TypeScript source"] --> Vite["tsc and Vite build"]
    Vite --> Public["backend/public embedded assets"]
    GoSource["Go source"] --> GoBuild["go build"]
    Public --> Binary["Single remote binary"]
    GoBuild --> Binary
    Binary --> Systemd["remote.futrx.service"]
```

The backend embeds the compiled frontend, so Caddy only needs to proxy the main origin to the Go process.

## Public routing

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Internet["Internet"] --> Caddy
    Caddy --> Main["host â†’ Go backend"]
    Caddy --> Launcher["code.host â†’ IDE launcher or slug path"]
    Caddy --> ProjectIDE["slug.code.host â†’ slug.lxd:8842"]
    Caddy --> Preview["slug--port.dev.host â†’ slug.lxd:port"]
    Caddy --> Inspector["preview /__remote_inspector â†’ Go backend"]

    ProjectIDE --> Auth["forward_auth /auth/verify"]
    Preview --> Auth
    Launcher --> Auth
    ProjectIDE --> TLS["on-demand TLS checked by /internal/tls-ask"]
    Preview --> TLS
```

Caddy validates its rendered configuration before replacing the live file. On-demand certificate requests are accepted only for existing project slugs and permitted hostname formats.

## Base-image build

```mermaid

    participant Builder as build-base-image
    participant LXD
    participant Ubuntu as Ubuntu 24.04 builder
    participant Alias as futrx-remote-dev-base

    Builder->>LXD: Delete leftover builder if present
    Builder->>Ubuntu: Launch temporary container
    Builder->>Ubuntu: Install system tools, Node, GitHub CLI, four agent CLIs
    Builder->>Ubuntu: Install Chromium and Agent Browser
    Builder->>Ubuntu: Install code-server
    Builder->>Ubuntu: Stop container
    Builder->>Alias: Publish reusable image
    Builder->>LXD: Remove temporary builder
```

The recipe is generated from the same provider profiles used by runtime CLI repair, keeping agent package versions consistent.

## Update flow

```mermaid

    Update["Run infra/update.sh"] --> Pull["Fetch and reset installed checkout to origin/main"]
    Pull --> Reexec["Re-execute the new updater"]
    Reexec --> Install["Converge dependencies, rebuild, restart, and health-check"]
    Install --> Rebuild["Rebuild base image"]
    Rebuild --> Scan["Read project container names from metadata"]
    Scan --> Busy{"Active lxc exec agent process?"}
    Busy -->|"Yes, default"| Skip["Skip busy container"]
    Busy -->|"No"| Delete["Delete replaceable container"]
    Delete --> Relaunch["Next start or prompt relaunches from new image"]
    Relaunch --> Mount["Reattach persistent workspace and provider homes"]
    Mount --> Provision["Reprovision tools and compatibility links"]
```

`--include-busy` forces busy workspace recycling. `--skip-workspaces` updates only the host and application. `upgrade-workspaces.sh --dry-run` shows the workspace plan without changing it.

The intended default is to skip active agent containers. The current busy-process matcher expects a different `lxc exec` argument order than the provider commands use, so it may classify an active run as idle. Until that detector is corrected, treat workspace recycling as disruptive: coordinate a maintenance window or use `--skip-workspaces` while runs are active.

The updater intentionally resets the installed application checkout to `origin/main`. Persistent application data and project workspaces live outside the tracked source tree.

## Startup reconciliation

When the backend starts, it:

1. loads file stores and in-memory indexes;
2. builds the agent and container service graph;
3. compares project metadata with LXD state;
4. updates stored project status;
5. loads the fleet resource policy (deriving it from host capacity on first run) and reapplies the managed profile plus project overrides;
6. starts the Agent Browser idle reaper;
7. starts the scheduled-task loop and restores persisted deadlines/claims;
8. begins serving the embedded SPA, API, and WebSockets.

## Container resource guardrails

The per-container envelope is operator policy, not a compile-time constant. It
lives in `DATA_DIR/resources.json`, is derived from this host's real capacity
on the first start that finds no such file, and is edited from
**Settings â†’ Resources** or `PUT /api/admin/resources`. Full reference:
[Resource limits](../02-workspaces/11-resource-limits.md).

| Policy field | Default on first run | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `defaults.memory` | host memory minus reserve, clamped to `[1GiB, 4GiB]` | Per-container memory ceiling |
| `defaults.cpu` | whole cores after the reserve, minimum 1 | Per-container core count |
| `defaults.processes` | `2000` | Fork-bomb guard |
| `defaults.disk` | a quarter of the filesystem, clamped to `[5GiB, 20GiB]` | Root-disk quota |
| `hostReserve.memory` | `768MiB` | Memory held back for the backend, LXD, Caddy, and sshd |
| `maxProjectOverride.*` | host capacity | Ceiling for a per-project override |
| `maxRunningContainers` | `0` (unlimited) | Cap on simultaneously running containers |

Two guardrails follow from this policy:

- **Aggregate admission.** Before a container is created or started, the sum of
  the memory ceilings of running containers plus the candidate is compared to
  host memory minus the reserve. A start that would exceed it is refused with
  `409`, which is what stops a host reboot from autostarting every workspace
  into an OOM. An admin can proceed with
  `POST /api/projects/{id}/start?force=1`. The guard fails open when LXD is
  unreachable.
- **Disk quotas need a capable pool.** LXD enforces a root-disk `size` only on
  `btrfs`, `zfs`, `lvm`, or `ceph`. On the `dir` pool that `lxd init --auto`
  often selects, the platform reports "unsupported on this pool" and skips the
  quota rather than failing the launch. Check with:

```bash
lxc profile device get default root pool
lxc storage show "$(lxc profile device get default root pool)"
```

To re-derive the policy after growing the host, stop the backend, delete
`DATA_DIR/resources.json`, and start it again. Editing the file by hand works
too; the backend reads it at startup and normalizes anything out of range.

## Scheduled-task guardrails

Scheduled tasks are host-owned unattended runs, so the backend applies three
independent limits:

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `SCHEDULE_MIN_INTERVAL` | `5m` | Minimum time between starts of one recurring task; Go duration syntax |
| `SCHEDULE_MAX_CONCURRENT` | `2` | Simultaneous scheduled runs across all chats |
| `SCHEDULE_MAX_TASKS_PER_PROJECT` | `20` | Non-terminal standing tasks in one project |

An explicit `0` disables a limit. **Run now** bypasses the interval and
concurrency admission limits, but the forced run still counts while active.
Terminal completed/exhausted/error definitions do not consume the
per-project task quota.

Create a systemd override rather than editing the installed unit template:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit remote.futrx
```

```ini
[Service]
Environment=SCHEDULE_MIN_INTERVAL=10m
Environment=SCHEDULE_MAX_CONCURRENT=1
Environment=SCHEDULE_MAX_TASKS_PER_PROJECT=10
```

Then apply it:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart remote.futrx
```

Restarting the backend interrupts control of interactive and scheduled runs.
Use a maintenance window. Before raising the limits, account for the fact that
each scheduled occurrence can start a project container and consume provider
quota, CPU, memory, network, and disk without an open browser.

## Health and recovery

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Backend["Backend restart"] --> Reconcile["Container status and limits reconcile"]
    Timer["Every minute"] --> MissingIP{"Running container has no IPv4 after boot grace?"}
    MissingIP -->|"Yes"| Reconfigure["networkctl reconfigure eth0"]
    UI["Manual Repair network"] --> Reconfigure
    Reconfigure --> Inspect["Reinspect for IPv4 up to five times"]
```

The server-info settings page reports host, CPU, memory, storage, network, and Go-process metrics. The project page reports the corresponding per-container diagnostics, and its Resources panel pairs them with the limits actually enforced.

## Backups and restore

`infra/steps/08-backup.sh` installs `remote-backup`, `remote-restore` and a nightly `remote-backup.timer` (03:30 UTC, ±20 min). A snapshot lands in `/var/backups/remote/<UTC-timestamp>/`:

| Part | Contents | Consistency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data.tar.zst` | `DATA_DIR` — users, projects, chats, secrets, session key, scheduled tasks | backend stopped for the seconds it takes to tar (containers, previews and IDEs stay up because of `KillMode=process`) |
| `projects.tar.zst` | `/var/lib/remote/projects/<slug>/{workspace,agent-home}` | live (agents may be writing; tar tolerates changed/removed files) |
| `hostcfg.tar.zst` | provider tokens (`/root/.claude*`, `.codex`, `.kimi-code`), Caddyfile, systemd units, LXD profile + container list | live |
| `containers/*.tar.gz` | `lxc export` of every container — only with `--with-containers` / `WITH_CONTAINERS=1` | live |
| `manifest.json`, `SHA256SUMS` | metadata + checksums | — |

Retention keeps the newest `KEEP_DAILY` (7) snapshots plus one per ISO week for `KEEP_WEEKLY` (4) weeks. Set `RCLONE_TARGET` in `/etc/remote-backup.env` (after `rclone config` as root) to copy each snapshot offsite; local disk is not a backup of the host itself.

```bash
remote-backup                       # snapshot now (prints the snapshot dir)
remote-backup --with-containers     # also export containers (slow, large)
remote-restore /var/backups/remote/<ts>            # data + projects + provider tokens
remote-restore /var/backups/remote/<ts> --data     # only DATA_DIR
```

`remote-restore` verifies checksums, stops the backend, moves the existing `DATA_DIR` / projects dir aside as `*.pre-restore-<ts>`, extracts, re-chowns workspaces to the container idmap (uid 1000000), and restarts. Containers are recreated from the base image on demand; workspaces and agent homes are bind-mounted back in.

`infra/steps/09-host-swap.sh` adds a 4 GiB swapfile (swappiness 10) on hosts with < 8 GiB RAM and no swap, so a busy container degrades instead of OOM-killing the host.

## Security controls

- The backend listens on loopback by default; Caddy is the public entry point.
- Platform sessions use secure, HTTP-only cookies.
- Preview and IDE requests use forward authentication; preview authorization is project-aware, while IDE authorization currently accepts any registered user.
- Platform cookies are removed before container proxying.
- Internal Caddy helper routes are denied externally.
- Secret, auth, access, and user files use restrictive permissions.
- SSH password and keyboard-interactive authentication are disabled after install.
- On-demand TLS issuance is restricted to valid, existing project hosts.
- Project containers are unprivileged and receive host workspaces through mapped ownership.
- Project containers currently share the LXD bridge without lateral ACLs; code-server and noVNC rely on Caddy for public authentication and do not independently authenticate direct bridge traffic.
