# Runtime and event parsing

This chapter follows one prompt from the chat WebSocket to a provider CLI and
back into Remote's persisted event stream. Provider packages own CLI syntax and
wire-protocol parsing. The service layer sees only the contracts in
[`internal/agent`](../../../backend/internal/agent/model.go).

```

The concrete entry points are:

1. [`ChatSocket.handle`](../../../backend/internal/transport/ws/chat_socket.go)
   validates the chat and caller, subscribes to replay plus live events, and
   accepts `prompt` and `cancel` messages.
2. [`prompt.Service.Start`](../../../backend/internal/service/prompt/service.go)
   acquires the process-local, one-run-per-chat lock in
   [`runhub.Hub`](../../../backend/internal/service/runhub/hub.go). A racing
   start returns `ErrPromptAlreadyRunning`; `clientId` acknowledgements are
   connection-local and are not persisted.
3. [`prompt.Service.runPromptAs`](../../../backend/internal/service/prompt/service.go)
   resolves chat state, prepares a provider-neutral request, looks up the
   registered runtime, and calls `Provider.Run`.
4. The provider launches and parses its own CLI. It emits
   [`agent.Event`](../../../backend/internal/agent/model.go) values without
   importing chat, transport, store, or frontend types.
5. [`emitAgentEvent`](../../../backend/internal/service/prompt/agent_events.go)
   persists session identity, projects recognized agent events into chat
   events, and sends them through the run hub. The hub appends them to the
   store before broadcasting them.

The run lock, subscriptions, and cancellation state are backend-memory state.
They disappear on restart, and Remote does not reattach to a provider process
that survives the backend.

## How `RunRequest` is built

[`agent.RunRequest`](../../../backend/internal/agent/model.go) is the only run
input a provider receives.

| Field | Source and meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Provider` | Normalized chat provider ID. Chat creation/update and the prompt boundary both enforce module membership and host/project scope. |
| `ConversationID` | Remote chat ID, used to correlate events and logs. It is not the provider-native session ID. |
| `Prompt` | Current prompt after optional visible-history recovery and provider-specific skill triggers are added. |
| `Cwd` | Live tmux working directory when available, otherwise stored chat cwd, then host home as a fallback. |
| `Model` | Saved model ID. The adapter must validate or safely pass it as one process/protocol argument. |
| `Mode` | Provider-neutral `default` or `plan`; the adapter translates it to native flags or protocol settings. |
| `ResumeID` | Session ID stored for the selected provider, but only when the descriptor declares resume support. |
| `Fork` | `ForkPending`, but only when the descriptor declares native fork support. |
| `ProjectID` | Empty for a loose host chat; otherwise identifies the workspace container. |
| `Preferences` | Saved reasoning effort, service tier, approval policy, and sandbox policy. Adapters decide which supported values to forward. |
| `EnableBrowser` | True only when the selected `browser` skill and the module's `BrowserTools` declaration both permit it. |
| `EnableScheduleTools` | True only for a project run when scheduled tools are declared and selected or the turn itself is scheduled. |
| `RuntimeEnv` | Short-lived backend-issued schedule API URL and grant. Invalid environment names are discarded and these values override same-named project secrets. |
| `InteractionResponses` | Run-scoped channel carrying explicit UI responses to provider-initiated requests. Providers without interactive protocols may ignore it. |

If no native session is available, the prompt service prepends visible `user`
and `assistant_text` history. The transcript is bounded to the last 24,000
bytes. Tool output and reasoning are not copied into that transcript. See
[`visibleTranscript`](../../../backend/internal/service/prompt/service.go) and
[`promptWithVisibleHistory`](../../../backend/internal/service/prompt/service.go).

Selected skills are translated from the module's declared strategy by
[`promptWithSelectedSkills`](../../../backend/internal/service/prompt/service.go):

- `slash-command` prefixes slash-style `/skill-name` triggers;
- `dollar-mention` adds `$skill-name` instructions;
- `instructions` points at the selected `SKILL.md` files;
- `none` leaves the prompt unchanged.

## Host and project execution

Every built-in provider has a provider-local command builder. A factory and
profile declare policy, but they do **not** automatically implement the
provider's native run command. A new adapter must translate `RunRequest`; for
project execution it receives the shared
[`agent.ProjectPreparer`](../../../backend/internal/agent/project.go) port
constructed by `module.Factory` through
[`service/agent/execution`](../../../backend/internal/service/agent/execution).

For a loose chat, built-ins execute the provider binary directly on the host
with the requested working directory and a filtered/augmented environment.

For a project chat, `execution.Preparer` owns this common workflow:

1. Resolve the project through [`agent.ProjectResolver`](../../../backend/internal/agent/project.go)
   and reject a missing container name.
2. Call `ProjectResolver.Start` even when stored state says `running`. This
   reconciles a container deleted or replaced outside the process.
3. Validate that [`provisioning.ContainerDependencies`](../../../backend/internal/agent/provisioning/container_dependencies.go)
   is either completely wired or completely zero. Production supplies the
   complete set.
4. Use the exact validated provider profile to ensure the CLI and, where
   supported, credentials. Publish shared instructions, the selected profile's
   non-secret runtime assets, and skill compatibility links; apply the
   provider factory's browser policy; provision scheduled tooling when
   requested; enable LXD boot autostart.
5. Load project secrets. Failure is currently best-effort and yields an empty
   secret list.

Before reconciliation the preparer emits `system/container_starting` only when
the stored project status is not running; it still calls `Start` on every
preparation. It emits `system/container_preparing` only when a nonzero set of
container ports enters the provisioning phase.

The preparer returns only the stable project/container target and secrets. The
adapter then calls
[`runtime.BuildContainerCommand`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/runtime/container_command.go)
to assemble `lxc exec`, normally from `/workspace`. Provider-owned fixed
environment entries come first, then project secrets, provider-forced entries,
and finally sorted backend runtime variables. Runtime keys mask same-named
secrets even when the runtime key is later discarded as invalid. The adapter
still owns its binary, arguments, stdin or positional prompt, and execution
protocol.

After a successful run, Claude, Codex, and Kimi make a best-effort credential
sync from the container. Its application-wide timeout currently defaults to
30 seconds through `config.AgentOptions`; Antigravity has no credential sync
contract.

Factories express only real policy differences:

| Provider | Credentials | Skill-link failure | Browser assets | Browser MCP/core |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | Seed from its profile | Best effort | Best effort | Required when Browser is enabled |
| Codex | Reject host API-key auth, then seed | Fatal | Best effort | Required when Browser is enabled |
| MiniMax | Require the host-managed Token Plan subscription key before preparation | Fatal | Best effort | Required when Browser is enabled |
| Kimi | Seed/synchronize its dynamic directory | Best effort | Best effort | Not used |
| Antigravity | None | Best effort | Not used | Not used |

Failures to list project secrets are currently ignored and the run continues
without them. Backend-issued runtime variables win over project secrets with
the same key. Codex additionally removes `OPENAI_API_KEY` and rejects a host
auth record explicitly marked as API-key authentication. It does not currently
pre-inspect a newer project-local auth record before launch. Its intended flow
is ChatGPT subscription authentication; see
[Authentication and access](04-authentication-and-access.md#current-provider-behavior)
for the current readiness-check limitation.

The provider-specific implementations are in:

- [`claude/command.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/claude/command.go)
- [`codex/command.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/codex/command.go)
- [`minimax/command.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/minimax/command.go)
- [`kimi/command.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/kimi/command.go)
- [`antigravity/command.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/antigravity/command.go)

The shared orchestration and command construction are in:

- [`service/agent/execution/preparer.go`](../../../backend/internal/service/agent/execution/preparer.go)
- [`integration/agents/runtime/container_command.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/runtime/container_command.go)

## Runtime and parser contracts

[`agent.Provider`](../../../backend/internal/agent/model.go) deliberately has
only three responsibilities:

```go
type Provider interface {
    ID() ProviderID
    Capabilities(context.Context, CapabilityRequest) (Capabilities, error)
    Run(context.Context, RunRequest, func(Event)) error
}
```

`Parser(req)` is **not** part of `agent.Provider`. Structured-stream adapters
may implement [`agent.LineParser`](../../../backend/internal/agent/parser.go)
and use [`runtime.RunProcess`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/runtime/process.go),
but a provider may own a different protocol loop.

`RunProcess` scans non-empty stdout lines, logs and skips individual parse
errors, emits every parsed event, and stops accepting additional stderr lines
for its `ProcessError` capture after the buffer reaches 64 KiB. Its default
stdout line limit is 16 MiB and stderr line limit is 1 MiB. Cancellation is
treated as a normal stop and returns `nil`. If the parser emitted `run.failed`
and the process then exits non-zero, it returns `agent.ErrRunFailed`;
otherwise a non-zero exit is returned as a process error.

An adapter must ensure that a successful native run produces a normalized
`run.completed` event. The shared line runner does not synthesize one merely
because a process exits zero. An adapter that already emitted `run.failed`
should return an error wrapping `agent.ErrRunFailed`; this prevents the prompt
service from appending a second generic `<provider> exit` error.

## Normalized agent events

The provider boundary uses [`agent.Event`](../../../backend/internal/agent/model.go).
The prompt projection currently recognizes the following types:

| Agent event | Persisted chat event | Required fields or behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session.updated` | `session` | Set `SessionID`; provider defaults to the selected provider when omitted. The ID is also saved in chat metadata. |
| `system` | `system` | Use `Subtype` and optional JSON `Data`; `Message` is not projected for system events. |
| `assistant.delta` | `assistant_text` | Put only newly produced text in `Text`. |
| `reasoning.delta` | `thinking` | Put only newly produced reasoning text in `Text`. |
| `tool.started` | `tool_use_start` | Set stable `ItemID`, `ToolName`, and JSON `Input`. |
| `tool.completed` | `tool_use_end` | Reuse `ItemID`; set `Output` and `IsError`. |
| `interaction.request` | `interaction_request` | Retain the original request ID, method, input, native IDs, and interaction kind until the UI or server resolves it. |
| `interaction.resolved` | `interaction_resolved` | Reuse the interaction ID and preserve resolution status without persisting secret response values. |
| `turn.status` or `run.interrupted` | `turn_status` | Preserve waiting/active/terminal status; interruption must not become successful completion. |
| `collaboration` | `collaboration` | Preserve provider-native subagent identity, state, and final messages. |
| `provider.native` | `provider_event` | Persist and render a generic fallback for valid provider activity without a typed projection. |
| `usage.updated` | `usage_update` | Publish the provider's latest normalized running usage. |
| `run.completed` | `complete` | Put normalized token data in `Usage` when the provider supplies it. |
| `run.failed` or `error` | `error` | Put safe user-facing text in `Message`. |

`run.started` exists in the agent enum but is not projected by
[`chatEventFromAgentEvent`](../../../backend/internal/service/prompt/agent_events.go),
so current adapters must not rely on it for user-visible state.
`agent.Event.Raw` remains diagnostic-only. A provider that needs native data to
survive persistence must put a bounded, safe payload and its correlation IDs
in `agent.Event.Native`.

## Provider parsing behavior

### Claude

[`claude.Provider.Run`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/claude/provider.go)
launches `claude -p --output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages
--verbose` and uses [`claude.Parser`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/claude/parser.go)
through `runtime.RunProcess`.

The parser maps:

- a changed `session_id` to `session.updated`;
- `stream_event` text deltas to `assistant.delta`;
- assistant `thinking` and `tool_use` blocks to reasoning/tool-start events;
- user `tool_result` blocks to tool completion;
- `system` records to normalized system events;
- `result` to `run.completed`, or to `run.failed` when `is_error` is true.

Malformed top-level JSON is returned to `RunProcess`, logged, and skipped.
Malformed nested messages are ignored after any session event already derived
from that line.

### Codex and MiniMax: production app-server path

Production Codex or MiniMax runs do **not** use
[`codex/parser.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/codex/parser.go).
[`codex.Provider.Run`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/codex/provider.go) starts
one fresh `codex app-server` process per turn and delegates to
[`codexharness.Run`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/codexharness/app_server_run.go).
[`minimax.Provider.Run`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/minimax/provider.go)
uses the same neutral harness with MiniMax's provider ID and label, while its
own adapter retains the endpoint, key environment variable, model catalog,
and isolated `CODEX_HOME`.
The process is ephemeral, while a persisted thread can still be resumed or
forked.

The normal JSON-RPC sequence is:

1. send `initialize` with Remote client information and experimental API
   support;
2. after its response, send `initialized` and `thread/start`, `thread/resume`,
   or `thread/fork`;
3. require a non-empty returned thread ID and model, emit `session.updated`
   for a new/different thread, then send `turn/start`;
4. retain the returned native turn ID, then select concurrently over App Server
   output, user interaction responses, and Remote cancellation;
5. consume notifications until `turn/completed` emits `run.completed`,
   `run.failed`, or `run.interrupted`; close stdin after that authoritative
   terminal notification.

[`appServerEventParser`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/codexharness/app_server_events.go)
maps agent/plan deltas, reasoning deltas, command execution, file changes, MCP
and dynamic tools, collaboration tools, web search, last-turn token usage, and
terminal turn state. It retains a versioned native envelope on typed events and
emits `provider.native` for unknown valid methods or item types. It tracks text
already emitted for each item so completed whole-text snapshots contribute
only the missing suffix.

[`appServerRequestHandler`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/codexharness/app_server_requests.go)
keeps every server-to-client request pending by its original string or numeric
JSON-RPC ID. The request is persisted and rendered as an interaction card.
The browser sends an explicit `interaction_response` WebSocket message, the
prompt service routes it to the active run, and the handler answers the same
App Server request. Remote does not infer a decision from Default or Plan mode.

Cancellation also remains inside the native lifecycle. The provider keeps the
process alive after the Remote context is cancelled, the harness sends
`turn/interrupt` once it knows both native IDs, and it waits for
`turn/completed(status=interrupted)`. Process termination is reserved for
protocol failure or interrupt timeout.

A failed `thread/resume` or `thread/fork` whose message contains `not found` or
`no rollout` becomes `agent.ErrSessionNotFound`. Other protocol errors are
wrapped in `runtime.ProcessError` with captured stderr.

See [Codex App Server architecture](08-codex-app-server-architecture.md) for
the complete component, interaction, persistence, cancellation, subagent, and
capability-discovery flows.

[`codex/parser.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/codex/parser.go) parses the
older `codex exec --json` JSONL shape and remains covered by focused tests, but
it is currently a compatibility parser rather than the production run path.
Do not use it as the reference when changing app-server event handling.

### Kimi

[`kimi.Provider.Run`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/kimi/provider.go) runs
`kimi -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json` through `RunProcess` and parses
it with [`kimi.Parser`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/kimi/parser.go).

Kimi's OpenAI-chat-shaped JSONL maps assistant content and tool calls, tool
results, and the final `role=meta,type=session.resume_hint` record. That final
record supplies a changed session ID and is also Kimi's de-facto
`run.completed`; the CLI does not provide a separate completion, reasoning, or
usage line. Because Kimi has no native fork primitive, `Run` clears `ResumeID`
when `Fork` is true.

### Antigravity

Antigravity print mode is unstructured. Production
[`antigravity.Provider.Run`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/antigravity/provider.go)
therefore bypasses `RunProcess` and streams raw stdout chunks as assistant
deltas so blank lines and Markdown paragraphs survive. It captures a 4 KiB
combined output tail for errors, maps sign-in-looking failures to a focused
instruction, and emits completion itself.

Because print mode does not report a new conversation ID, the adapter snapshots
the provider's `brain` directory before and after a fresh run. Exactly one new,
valid directory becomes `session.updated`; zero or multiple candidates are
treated as ambiguous and no session is saved. See
[`antigravity/session.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/antigravity/session.go).
Its [`parser.go`](../../../backend/internal/integration/agents/antigravity/parser.go) is a
line-oriented test/helper parser, not the production chunk-streaming path.
Antigravity and Kimi both clear resume state for requested forks because their
descriptors do not declare native fork support.

## Sessions, forks, and recovery

Sessions are stored in the provider-keyed `Meta.Sessions` map. The four named
session fields remain only as compatibility mirrors for older records and
clients. A new provider needs no new storage field. See
[`chat.Meta.NormalizeSessions`](../../../backend/internal/service/chat/model.go)
and [`filechat` records](../../../backend/internal/stores/filechat/records.go).

The module descriptor controls orchestration:

- without `Resume`, the prompt service never passes the saved ID;
- `Fork` is invalid unless `Resume` is also true;
- chat forking preserves and marks a provider session only when native fork is
  declared; otherwise the copied chat starts fresh from visible history;
- a `session.updated` event clears `ForkPending` and may populate an empty chat
  model from the provider's reported model.

Any adapter may return `agent.ErrSessionNotFound`. When it does so during a
resume, the prompt service clears only that provider's saved session, clears
the pending fork, persists a `system/session_recovered` event, rebuilds a
bounded visible transcript, and retries the turn once without `ResumeID`.

## Failure and cancellation rules

- The WebSocket `cancel` path calls the run's context cancellation. Providers
  must launch children with that context; the in-memory run lock is released
  when the run goroutine returns.
- A cancellation is not persisted as an error by the shared process runner.
- Parser errors for individual structured lines are logged and skipped so one
  malformed provider message does not discard the rest of the turn.
- If a provider returns an error other than `agent.ErrRunFailed`, the prompt
  service persists `<provider> exit: <error>`.
- A provider-emitted `run.failed`/`error` is already persisted through the
  normal event projection. Return `agent.ErrRunFailed` to avoid duplicating it.
- `run.completed` and provider error events are persisted. Run-hub `sync`
  state and prompt accepted/rejected acknowledgements are transient.

## Tests to add for a run adapter

In the concrete provider package, pin the behavior the adapter owns:

- exact Default and Plan command/protocol translation;
- model, effort, service-tier, resume, fork, browser, and schedule behavior the
  descriptor claims;
- provider preparation-policy declarations;
- provider-native host/project arguments and environment entries;
- session discovery and `ErrSessionNotFound` mapping;
- text/reasoning deltas, tool start/end correlation, completion with usage, and
  failure parsing;
- malformed/unknown native records and cancellation;
- compile-time `var _ agent.Provider = (*Provider)(nil)` in `factory.go`.

Keep shared workflow tests in their owning packages: project reconciliation,
provisioning order, error text, and best-effort branches belong under
`internal/service/agent/execution`; common container command and environment
precedence belong under `internal/integration/agents/runtime`; factory projection and
validation belong under `internal/service/agent/module`.

Run focused tests first, then from `backend/` run:

```bash
go test ./internal/integration/agents/<id> ./internal/integration/agents/runtime ./internal/service/agent/execution ./internal/service/agent/module ./internal/service/prompt
go test -race ./internal/integration/agents/<id> ./internal/integration/agents/runtime ./internal/service/agent/execution ./internal/service/prompt
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```
