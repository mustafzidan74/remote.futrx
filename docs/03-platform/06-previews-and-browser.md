# Previews and browser features

There are two browser systems:

| System | Purpose | Browser process |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App preview | Show a web app already running in the project | The user's normal browser loads the project app in an iframe |
| Agent Browser | Share a signed-in, headed browser between user and agent | Chromium runs inside the project container |

## App discovery and preview URLs

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    App["Project process listens on TCP port"] --> Scan["Backend scans with ss"]
    Scan --> Filter["Exclude loopback-only listeners and deduplicate ports"]
    Filter --> Picker["Browser drawer app picker"]
    Picker --> URL["https://slug--port.dev.host"]
    URL --> Caddy["Caddy authenticates request"]
    Caddy --> DNS["slug.lxd:port"]
    DNS --> App
```

The UI prefers a preview URL recently mentioned in chat when it matches the current project and a discovered port. Otherwise it selects a discovered listener.

Preview host rules:

- Port must be between 1024 and 65535.
- On-demand TLS asks the backend to confirm the slug is a real project before certificate issuance.
- The authenticated user must be an admin or project member, or the request must carry a valid public share link for that exact slug and port.
- Platform cookies are stripped before the request enters project code.

## Quick access to a preview

Reaching a preview does not require the project settings page. Two entry points
open the same panel:

- **Sidebar project row.** A globe button next to each project lists the ports
  that project is listening on right now.
- **Chat header chip.** When the chat's project has at least one shareable
  listener, a `Preview :<port>` chip opens that port in a new tab; its caret
  opens the same panel for the other ports.

Each row offers **Open**, **Copy URL**, and **Share 24h** — the last creates a
public link through the same share API and copies the one-time URL, which is
also printed in the panel in case the clipboard was refused. Platform ports
(6080 noVNC, 8842 and 8081 code-server, 9222 CDP) are listed so their presence
is explained, but they carry no Share action; the share service refuses them
anyway.

The chip picks the port that already has a live public link, falling back to the
lowest non-platform port. Ports are re-scanned when a panel opens, every 15
seconds while it stays open, and once each time an agent turn finishes — the
workspace WebSocket carries no listener events to piggyback on, and each scan
costs an `ss` run inside the container. A project whose container is stopped,
missing, or still provisioning reports that state instead of scanning.

## Public share links

A preview can be shown to someone who has no platform account. A project member creates a share link for one port; the link authorizes that port and nothing else.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Client as Outside viewer
    participant Caddy
    participant Verify as /auth/verify
    participant Store as projectshares store
    participant App as Project app

    Client->>Caddy: GET https://slug--port.dev.host/?share=TOKEN
    Caddy->>Verify: forward_auth with X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Uri
    Verify->>Store: match SHA-256 of TOKEN for this slug and port
    Store-->>Verify: live, unexpired, unrevoked link
    Verify-->>Client: 302 to the same URL without the token, Set-Cookie remote_share
    Client->>Caddy: GET https://slug--port.dev.host/
    Caddy->>Verify: forward_auth with the remote_share cookie
    Verify->>Store: is that link still live?
    Verify-->>Caddy: 200
    Caddy->>App: proxy with remote_share stripped
```

Properties that make this safe to hand out:

- **One port, one project.** The token is bound to the project slug and the port. It is refused on any other host, on `*.code.<host>`, on port 6080 (Agent Browser noVNC), and on the main application.
- **Nothing replayable is stored.** `DATA_DIR/projectshares/<projectId>.json` holds only a SHA-256 digest of each token, plus port, label, creator, timestamps, and a revocation stamp.
- **Time-boxed.** Default lifetime 24 hours; the UI offers 1 hour, 24 hours, and 7 days; the service refuses anything under 1 hour or over 30 days.
- **Revocable immediately.** Every request re-reads the link from the store, so revoking one stops the next request, cookie or not.
- **Host-scoped cookie.** `remote_share` is set without a `Domain`, so the browser sends it only to that one `<slug>--<port>.dev.<host>` origin. Its value is `{slug, port, shareId, exp}` signed with the same HMAC key as platform sessions, under a separate domain-separation tag so a share pass can never verify as a session.
- **Token leaves the URL immediately.** The first response is a redirect to the same URL minus `?share=`, so the token stays out of browser history, `Referer`, and the project's own logs. The redirect is also what makes `Set-Cookie` reach the browser: Caddy's `forward_auth` discards the auth response on 2xx and relays only non-2xx responses.
- **Stripped at the container boundary.** `remote_share` is in the Caddyfile `header_up` cookie-strip list, so code running inside the container never sees it.

Endpoints (project membership required; admins reach every project):

| Method | Path | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/projects/{id}/shares` | Creates a link from `{port, ttlHours?, label?}` and returns the full URL **once** |
| `GET` | `/api/projects/{id}/shares` | Lists live links as metadata — never a token or digest |
| `DELETE` | `/api/projects/{id}/shares/{shareId}` | Revokes one link |

Operators create and revoke links under **Project settings → Sharing → Public preview links**, which lists each discovered port with a lifetime selector and a Share action.

Changing the cookie-strip list means the Caddyfile template changed, so an existing box needs `sudo bash infra/install.sh` (step `03-caddy.sh`) or `infra/update.sh` before share cookies stop reaching containers.

## Preview inspection

Inspect mode wraps the selected app with `/__remote_inspector` on the same preview origin. Same-origin access lets the wrapper inspect the inner app iframe.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant UI as Main chat UI
    participant Wrapper as Inspector wrapper
    participant App as Project app iframe

    User->>UI: Enable inspect mode
    UI->>Wrapper: Load wrapper with app URL
    Wrapper->>App: Load app on the same preview origin
    Wrapper-->>UI: remote-inspector:ready
    UI->>Wrapper: Enable selection
    User->>App: Hover and click element
    Wrapper->>Wrapper: Collect selector, text, HTML, box, styles, parents
    Wrapper-->>UI: element-selected payload
    UI->>UI: Insert Browser element block into composer
```

The payload is bounded and includes enough layout and accessibility context for an agent to identify the selected element. Selecting an element exits inspect mode.

## Agent Browser architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User["User"] -->|"noVNC iframe"| View["VNC and noVNC view"]
    Agent["Selected agent CLI"] -->|"MCP over CDP"| Chrome["Headed Chromium"]
    View --> Display["Shared virtual display"]
    Chrome --> Display
    Chrome --> Profile["Persistent browser profile in workspace"]
    Display --> Xvfb["Xvfb and window manager"]
```

The user can sign in visually while the agent controls the same Chromium session. Browser profile data lives under the project workspace, so site logins survive container replacement.

## Agent Browser lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Stopped
    Stopped --> Starting: open Agent Browser or select browser skill
    Starting --> CoreReady: Chromium and CDP ready, no human view
    Starting --> Ready: core and noVNC ready
    CoreReady --> Ready: start human view
    Ready --> CoreReady: close drawer, stop view only
    CoreReady --> Stopped: explicit stop or idle reaper
    Ready --> Stopped: explicit stop or idle reaper
    Starting --> Error: provision or start failure
    Error --> Starting: retry
```

Frontend behavior:

- Opening Agent Browser calls the start endpoint, polls every 1.5 seconds, and sends a status heartbeat every 15 seconds.
- Closing the drawer stops only the noVNC view; the agent-facing core stays available.
- Explicit Stop tears down the complete browser stack but keeps the profile.

Backend behavior:

- Starting the browser first ensures the project container is running.
- Provisioning installs missing browser packages and republishes versioned scripts.
- A selected `browser` skill enables the provider's browser MCP config.
- Active browser-enabled prompts send a keepalive every minute.
- A reaper checks every minute and stops a browser after 20 minutes without pane or agent activity, unless a viewer is connected.

## URL and proxy layout

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Main["https://host"] --> Backend["Main UI and API"]
    IDELauncher["https://code.host"] --> Launcher["Installable IDE launcher"]
    IDEProject["https://slug.code.host"] --> CodeServer["slug.lxd:8842"]
    Preview["https://slug--port.dev.host"] --> ProjectApp["slug.lxd:port"]
    AgentView["https://slug--6080.dev.host"] --> NoVNC["slug.lxd:6080"]
```

The installer configures host DNS resolution for `.lxd` names through the LXD bridge. Caddy handles public HTTPS and routes to private container addresses.

## Security boundary

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Request["Public subdomain request"] --> TLS["On-demand TLS allow check"]
    TLS --> Auth["Platform session and membership check"]
    Auth -->|"preview hosts only"| Share["Share link or share cookie check"]
    Auth --> Strip["Strip platform cookies"]
    Share --> Strip
    Strip --> Container["Untrusted project app, IDE, or noVNC"]
```

Project apps may set and receive their own cookies. Only the platform's session, OAuth-state, return-location, and share cookies are removed.
