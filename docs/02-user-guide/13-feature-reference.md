# Complete feature reference

This is the compact inventory of current Remote behavior. “Page” means the loaded browser application; “host” means the Remote server; “project” means the durable workspace and its LXD container.

## Navigation and project list

| Feature | How to use it | Availability and persistence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home dashboard | Select **Home** in the sidebar, the **Workspace** heading, or **Home** in the command palette; it is also the landing view when no chat is selected | Any registered user; membership-scoped, refreshes every 60 s while visible |
| Expand or collapse sidebar | Use the chevron in the sidebar header | Persists in browser local storage |
| Mobile sidebar | Use the menu button; tap outside or close to dismiss | Responsive UI |
| Search projects and chats | Type in **Search projects and chats**; clear with **×** | Filters names and visible groups |
| Project and chat counts | Read the summary below search | Live workspace state |
| Create project | Choose the blue **+**, enter a name | Any registered user; project persists |
| Reorder projects | Drag a project group when no search is active | Saved project order |
| Expand project group | Use the project chevron | Per loaded page |
| Inspect project | Use the gear beside the project name | Members and admins |
| Create project chat | Use the **+** beside a provisioned project | Members and admins |
| Provisioning and errors | Read the disabled/spinning new-chat control or project error text | Live workspace updates |
| Chat model and time | Read each chat row's model badge and relative time | Persisted metadata |
| Running indicator | Spinner beside an active chat | Live run state |
| Unread indicator | Green dot beside completed unseen work | Persisted `lastReadAt` |
| Mark read or unread | Hover a chat and use the eye control | Persisted |
| Fork chat | Hover a chat and use the fork control | New persisted chat |
| Delete chat | Hover a chat and use **×**, then confirm | Removes chat metadata/history |
| Loose chats | Appear under **Unassigned** | Run on the host and are outside project isolation; avoid |
| Account settings and sign-out | Use the account footer | Current user/session |

## Chat composer

| Feature | How to use it | Important behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider | Choose **Codex**, **Claude**, **Kimi**, or **Antigravity** | Cannot change while streaming |
| Model | Open **Model** and select a provider model or Auto | Stored per chat |
| Thinking | Select Auto, None/Minimal where supported, or Low through Ultra | Provider-dependent |
| Speed | Select Codex Auto, Default, Priority, or Fast | Codex only; model/provider may gate it |
| Mode | Choose Chat, Plan, Code, Review, Debug, or Full auto | Advisory prompt policy, not enforcement |
| Skill picker | Open **Skill set**, search, and select | Catalog depends on provider/project |
| Skill chips | Review or remove selected skills | Cleared when provider changes |
| Playbooks | Open **⚡ Playbooks** and select one | Applies its skills/mode/provider, then inserts the prompt; Shift-click sends it |
| Playbook placeholder | A playbook stops with `{{…}}` still in the text | The token is selected for you; such a prompt is never auto-sent |
| Voice input | Press the microphone, speak, press it again | Text lands at the caret for review; never auto-sent. Hidden when the browser has no speech API and no server fallback is configured |
| Dictation language | Use the chevron beside the microphone | Arabic (Egypt/Saudi) or English (US/UK), or the browser language; defaults to `ar-EG` on an Arabic browser and `en-US` otherwise, is always named in the microphone's tooltip, and is remembered per device in local storage |
| Test microphone | **Test microphone (2s)** in the microphone menu | Records two seconds and reports the input level, separating a dead microphone from failed recognition |
| Dictation diagnostics | **What happened last time** in the microphone menu | The last few lifecycle lines: which language started, which error code arrived, whether the browser restarted the session |
| Server transcription | Tick **Use server transcription** in the microphone menu | Only when an admin configured it; records the clip and transcribes it after you stop |
| Attach picker | Choose **+** and select one or more files | Project chats; resumable uploads |
| Drag attachment | Drag files over the composer | Same upload path |
| Paste image | Paste image clipboard data into the composer | Same upload path |
| Attachment chips | Monitor or remove before sending | Saved file path is added to prompt |
| Prompt text | Type the instruction; Shift+Enter adds a line | Draft survives chat switching and same-tab reloads |
| Send | Press Enter or use the arrow | One active run per chat |
| Queue | Send while streaming | Per-tab `sessionStorage`; not a server-side job |
| Remove queued prompt | Use **×** on a queue chip | Before it auto-sends |
| Cancel | Use the red square or Escape while running | Cancels active provider context |

Escape has two jobs in the composer: while the microphone is live it stops
dictation, and the run-cancel shortcut stands down for that press. A second
Escape cancels the run as usual.

The placeholder mentions `@` files and `/` commands, but the current source has no implemented mention or slash-command picker. Use the attachment control and skill picker instead.

## Conversation and messages

| Feature | Visible behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Streaming text | Assistant output appears incrementally |
| Reasoning | Provider reasoning/thinking parts are rendered when emitted |
| Tool groups | Consecutive tools are grouped and expandable |
| Specialized tools | Read, write, edit, search, shell, and questions have tailored cards |
| Generic tools | Unknown tools use a generic renderer |
| Markdown | Headings, lists, links, tables, blockquotes, and code render in messages |
| Syntax highlighting | Code fences receive language-aware highlighting |
| AskUserQuestion | Agent questions become a paged single/multi-select form with **Other** |
| Usage | Supported providers report accumulated token usage |
| Working state | Header dot, provider label, sidebar spinner, and composer state update |
| Load older | Older JSONL events page backward |
| Jump to latest | Appears when reading above the newest output |
| Reconnect/replay | Chat socket resumes from the last event sequence |
| Automatic title | Remote can title a new chat from its early content; it is persisted, and the current UI has no manual rename control |
| Rewind | Deletes the selected point and later events; next run starts fresh |
| Fork | Copies visible history; provider-specific session fork happens on next run |
| Error block | Run and transport failures render in the thread |
| Schedules drawer | Project-chat header lists, edits, arms, pauses, runs, and deletes scheduled tasks |

There is no approval workflow in the current chat transport. Project agents run with provider approval/sandbox bypasses inside the project container.

## Providers and current differences

| Capability | Claude | Codex | Kimi | Antigravity |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Sign-in | Host authorization URL and pasted code | Host device flow | Host device flow | Run `agy` in each project Terminal |
| Model picker | Yes | Yes | Auto only | Auto only |
| Thinking control | Yes | Yes | No current options | Auto, Low, Medium, High |
| Speed/service tier | No | Yes | No | No |
| Usage telemetry | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Provider session fork | Yes | Yes, rollout clone | No; starts fresh | No; starts fresh |
| Selected skill trigger | Yes | Yes | Stored but not injected | Scheduled Tasks only |
| Browser MCP | Yes | Yes | No equivalent plumbing | No equivalent plumbing |
| Structured tool stream | Yes | Yes | Yes | No; plain streamed text |

Antigravity's project-local `/root/.gemini` state survives stop/start but not
container replacement.

## Workspace tools

| Feature | How to use it | Limits or lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open in IDE | Choose **Open in IDE** in a project chat | code-server in `/workspace`; registered-user auth caveat |
| Installable IDE launcher | Open `code.<host>` and use the browser's install action | PWA launcher with live project list; the main Remote app is not a PWA |
| Open Terminal | Choose **Open Terminal** | New `bash -l` PTY; closing kills it; no reconnect |
| Open History | Choose **History** | Git repositories only |
| Open Files | Choose **Files** | Lazy workspace tree |
| Open Browser | Choose **Open Browser** | Preview or Agent Browser |
| Refresh Files | Use the drawer refresh control | Reloads root |
| Expand folder | Select folder row | Lazy-loads children |
| Open file | Select a file or search result | Supported media opens in-app; other non-archives open in IDE; unsupported media/archives download |
| Search filenames | Type at least two characters | 300 results; 200,000 visited-entry cap |
| Download file | Hover a file and choose download | Direct file response |
| Download folder | Hover a folder and choose download | ZIP up to 1 GiB; two concurrent |
| Inline media link | Open a supported workspace link from chat | Images, audio, video, PDF allowlist and full-screen viewer |
| IDE file link | Open a validated workspace path from chat or Files | Path-contained redirect with optional exact `:line[:column]` |

The **History** button is hidden until Remote discovers at least one repository.
It checks again after every completed run. The diff view groups files into
collapsible cards with line-number gutters, hunk headers, change counts, and
new/deleted/binary badges; unparseable patches fall back to raw text.

## Scheduled tasks

| Feature | How to use it | Important behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | Select **Scheduled Tasks** skill and explicitly ask the agent | Agent-created tasks start paused |
| Arm | Open **Schedules** and select **Arm** | Human review is required before the first automatic run |
| One-time timing | Ask for an exact time with timezone | One successful occurrence |
| Recurring timing | Ask for five-field cron plus IANA timezone | Default minimum interval is 5 minutes |
| Edit | Open the task editor | Name, prompt, time/cron, timezone, max runs |
| Pause or resume | Use the task's primary control | Only paused tasks can resume |
| Run now | Use **Run now** | Does not move the normal deadline |
| Delete | Use the trash control and confirm | Removes definition and run history |
| Observe | Read next/last run, result, count, owner, and error | Runs appear as ordinary turns in the chat transcript |
| Complete standing task | Agent calls the scoped completion command during a scheduled run | Stops future runs and retains history |

Schedules exist only for project chats. Members see and manage their own tasks;
admins can see and manage all tasks. Defaults are 20 standing tasks per
project and two concurrent scheduled runs server-wide. Busy occurrences
coalesce into one follow-up under the default overlap policy.

## App preview and inspection

| Feature | How to use it | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discover apps | Open Browser or choose refresh | Non-loopback listeners, ports 1024–65535 |
| Select app | Use the process/port picker | One preview target at a time |
| Remember mentioned URL | Agent mentions a matching project preview URL | UI prefers the recent matching URL |
| Resize drawer | Drag the divider | Persists in browser local storage |
| Reload | Use the reload control | Reloads selected frame |
| Open externally | Use the external-link control | New authenticated tab |
| Inspect element | Toggle crosshair, then click the element | Same-origin inspector wrapper |
| Insert element context | Happens after selection | Selector, text, HTML, bounds, styles, parents |
| Preview authentication | Sign in to Remote | Admin or project member |
| Preview hostname | `slug--port.dev.<host>` | On-demand TLS and known-project check |
| Open in Agent Browser | Use **Agent Browser** on a port row | Starts the shared browser and loads `127.0.0.1:<port>` inside the container |

## Agent Browser

| Feature | How to use it | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start human browser view | Toggle the key control in Browser | Starts project Chromium/noVNC as needed |
| Share login with agent | Sign in visually, then select `browser` skill | Claude/Codex share the same profile/window |
| Human intervention | Type or click in the live pane | Same session as agent |
| Reload view | Use reload while ready | Reloads noVNC iframe |
| Close drawer | Close Browser | Stops only the human view |
| Stop complete stack | Use the square stop control | Stops browser core and view; keeps profile |
| Persist site sessions | Reopen the project browser | Profile lives in workspace |
| Automatic reaping | Leave view and agent inactive | Stops after roughly 20 minutes |

There is one fixed 1366×768 browser session per project, unrestricted network egress, and no per-task browser isolation.

## Git history

| Feature | How to use it | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discover repositories | Open **History** | Workspace root through depth 6 with exclusions |
| Select repository | Use repository picker | Shows path and dirty/clean state |
| List commits | Select repository | UI asks for 100; backend caps at 200 |
| View commit | Select a commit | Shows subject, author, date, SHA |
| View diff | Select a commit | Structured per-file view; truncates at 768 KiB |
| Refresh | Use refresh control | Re-discovers repository state |
| Switch commit | Select a commit and choose **Switch** on a clean tree | Detached HEAD checkout |
| Safety checkpoint backend | Checkout API accepts a checkpoint message | Backend stages all, commits, then switches; current drawer does not render the required dirty-tree form |

## Project settings

| Tab | Features |
| --- | --- |
| Info | Container/OS/resources/disks/network/mounts/limits/agent versions/auth-bundle state, refresh, network repair |

## Features Remote does not currently provide

- anonymous/public preview sharing;
- read-only project membership;
- per-user provider accounts or quotas;
- enforced approval prompts for agent tools;
- durable server-side prompt queues;
- run reattachment after backend restart;
- terminal reconnect;
- the visible Git dirty-tree checkpoint form, despite backend support;
- project IDE membership enforcement;
- built-in backup/restore, metrics endpoint, or high availability;
- content search in Files;
- a main-app PWA, push notification, or offline mode;
- current application voice dictation;
