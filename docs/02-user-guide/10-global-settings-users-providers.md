# Global settings, users, and providers

Open **Settings** from the account footer or the collapsed sidebar gear. The page has six tabs: **Appearance**, **Agents**, **Users**, **Resources**, **Updates**, and **Info**.
Open **Settings** from the account footer or the collapsed sidebar gear. The page has six tabs: **Appearance**, **Agents**, **Users**, **Audit log**, **Updates**, and **Info**.

## Appearance

Choose how Remote looks on the current device:

- **System** follows the browser or operating-system preference.
- **Dark** always uses the dark theme.
- **Light** always uses the light theme.

The preference is saved to your Remote user settings. Wait for the **Saved** state before leaving if the network is slow.

## Agents

Claude, Codex, and Kimi authentication is host-wide and
administrator-managed. Sign in once on the parent host; Remote then seeds
those provider credentials into project containers. Antigravity uses a
different per-project flow described below.

### Connect Claude

1. Open **Settings → Agents**.
2. Under **Claude authentication**, choose **Sign in with Claude**.
3. Open the displayed Anthropic authorization link.
4. Complete sign-in in the new tab.
5. Paste the returned code into Remote.
6. Choose **Submit code**.
7. Wait for **Subscription signed in**.

Use **Refresh Claude login** to replace an expired or unwanted host credential.

### Connect Codex

1. Under **Codex authentication**, choose the device-login action.
2. Open the verification URL.
3. Enter the displayed device code.
4. Approve the OpenAI account.
5. Return to Remote and wait for the connected state.

Remote may also detect a configured API key, but subscription/device authentication is the intended shared-host flow.

### Connect Kimi

1. Under **Kimi authentication**, start device login.
2. Open the verification URL.
3. Enter the displayed code.
4. Approve the account.
5. Return to Remote and wait for the connected state.

### Use Antigravity

Antigravity appears in the chat provider picker but not in the global
**Agents** cards. Its `agy` CLI does not expose a host-wide sign-in flow that
Remote can complete and distribute.

Sign in separately in each project:

1. Open a chat in the project.
2. Select **Open Terminal**.
3. Run `agy`.
4. Complete the URL-and-code flow displayed by Antigravity.
5. Exit the interactive CLI.
6. Return to the chat and select **Antigravity**.

That sign-in is shared with other users and agents inside the same project
container. Its files live under `/root/.gemini`, not one of Remote's durable
provider-home mounts. They survive ordinary stop/start but disappear when the
container is replaced; sign in again after an upgrade or recovery that
recreates the container.

Antigravity does not satisfy Remote's initial “at least one provider connected”
gate. A server administrator must still connect Claude, Codex, or Kimi during
onboarding.

### Shared-provider implications

- Every user and project shares the same host Claude, Codex, and Kimi accounts
  and their quotas.
- Those three provider credentials are copied into project credential
  locations.
- An agent that can read its project credential files can act with that provider authority.
- Claude, Codex, and Kimi homes are durable but separate by provider format, not separate security principals.
- Re-authentication can affect every project.
- Antigravity is project-local rather than host-wide, but its credential state
  is still readable by container root and shared by everyone with authority in
  that project.

Non-admins can use connected providers but cannot connect or refresh them.

## Users

Remote has one local password administrator. Additional users sign in through Google OAuth and must be registered before they can enter.

### Configure Google OAuth

Administrator steps:

1. Create an OAuth web client in Google Cloud.
2. Add the callback URL shown in **Settings → Users**.
3. Copy the Google client ID and client secret into Remote.
4. Save and confirm that Google sign-in is enabled.

The Google client secret is stored on the host in plaintext with restrictive file permissions.

> **Current authentication caveat:** Remote authorizes Google users by normalized email, does not check Google's `verified_email` claim, does not bind invitations to the immutable Google `sub`, and does not enforce a hosted-domain (`hd`) restriction. Treat invitations on custom domains with care and read the [threat model](../threat-model.md) before enabling multi-user access.

### Add a user

1. Open **Settings → Users**.
2. Enter the user's exact Google-account email.
3. Choose **member** or **admin**.
4. Choose **Add**.
5. Add a member to specific projects through each project's **Sharing** tab.

There is no public sign-up. A successful Google identity that is not in the user directory is denied.

### Change a role

Administrators can promote a member to admin or demote an invited admin to member.

- An **admin** can manage global providers, Google OAuth, users, all projects, resource limits, and deletion.
- A **member** sees only projects where their email is a member, plus any loose chats.

The local administrator cannot be removed or demoted. Remote also prevents removal or demotion of the final administrator.

### Remove a user

1. Find the user under **Users**.
2. Choose the remove action.
3. Confirm that access should end.

Removal blocks future authenticated requests for that email. Sessions are stateless 30-day tokens and have no individual revocation UI; deleting a user is the practical access-control lever.

## Resources

Administrators use **Resources** to set the CPU, memory, process, and disk
envelope every project container inherits, plus the memory held back for the
platform itself and the ceiling a per-project override may not pass. The panel
shows the host's real capacity, how much of it running workspaces already
commit, and whether the storage pool can enforce disk quotas at all. Saving
converges the managed LXD profile immediately. Full reference:
[Resource limits](../02-workspaces/11-resource-limits.md).

## Audit log

**Audit log** is admin-only. It lists what people did on this server, newest
first: sign-ins and sign-outs, project creation, renaming, and deletion,
membership changes, secret reads and writes, container starts and stops, agent
runs, scheduled-task changes, settings changes, self-updates, and workspace
file, terminal, and IDE access.

Each row shows the time, the actor, the action, the target, the caller's IP
address, and whether the action succeeded. Failed attempts are listed too, with
the reason.

To narrow the list:

1. Type an email in **Actor** to see one person's activity.
2. Type an action in **Action**. Matching is by prefix, so `project.` selects
   every project action and `project.secret.` only the secret ones.
3. Set **From** and **To** for a date range.
4. Choose **Apply filters**. **Clear** returns to the full list.

**Load older entries** pages further back. **Export** downloads the matching
date range as a JSONL file for archiving or offline analysis.

Entries are kept for a retention window the server operator configures
(twelve months by default), after which whole months are deleted. See
[Audit log](../04-operations/10-audit-log.md) for the entry format, the full
action list, and retention configuration.

Members see a notice instead of the table.

## Info

Use **Info** to inspect the parent host rather than one project container.

The page reports:

- current account email and role;
- server URL and collection time;
- CPU model, usage, load, and core counts;
- total, used, available, cached memory, and swap;
- filesystem mounts, capacity, used space, and free space;
- interfaces, addresses, and traffic counters;
- operating system, kernel, architecture, Go version, and uptime;
- backend PID, goroutines, file handles, heap, and system memory;
- configured application and storage paths.

Choose **Refresh** for a new point-in-time sample. These readings are operational observations, not performance guarantees.

## Sign out

Use the sign-out control in the account footer. This clears the platform session cookie from the browser. It does not disconnect host-wide agent-provider accounts.
