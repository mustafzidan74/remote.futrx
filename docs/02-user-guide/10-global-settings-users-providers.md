# Global settings, users, and providers

Open **Settings** from the account footer or the collapsed sidebar gear. The
tabs are grouped into **Personal** (Appearance, Notifications, Security),
**Agents**, **Platform** (Users, Resources, Secrets vault, Trash, Updates), and
**Insights** (Usage, Audit log, Info). Members see only the tabs their role can
use.

## Appearance

Choose how Remote looks on the current device:

- **System** follows the browser or operating-system preference.
- **Dark** always uses the dark theme.
- **Light** always uses the light theme.

The preference is saved to your Remote user settings. Wait for the **Saved** state before leaving if the network is slow.

## Agents

For an administrator, the **Agents** list is generated from the server's
ordered agent module catalog.
Each card uses the module label, authentication mode, current normalized
status, and provider-owned instructions. Managed authorization-code and device
flows expose the appropriate controls; external providers show their sign-in
instructions without a host-login button; a no-auth module is reported ready
without login controls.

Claude, Codex, and Kimi authentication is host-wide and administrator-managed.
Sign in once on the parent host; Remote then seeds those provider credentials
into project containers. MiniMax uses a host-managed Token Plan subscription
key. Antigravity uses a project-local sign-in flow; both are described below.

### Connect Claude

1. Open **Settings → Agents**.
2. Under **Claude authentication**, choose **Sign in with Claude**.
3. Open the displayed Anthropic authorization link.
4. Complete sign-in in the new tab.
5. Paste the returned code into Remote.
6. Choose **Submit code**.
7. Wait for **Subscription signed in**.

Use **Refresh Claude login** to replace an expired or unwanted host credential.
When Remote detects the completed login, it requests a refresh for model
catalogs currently open in that browser. A project probe sees the credentials
currently present inside its container, so if a later run propagates new host
credentials, choose **Refresh models** again afterward.

### Connect Codex

1. Under **Codex authentication**, choose the device-login action.
2. Open the verification URL.
3. Enter the displayed device code.
4. Approve the OpenAI account.
5. Return to Remote and wait for the connected state.

Remote may also detect a configured API key, but subscription/device authentication is the intended shared-host flow.

### Use MiniMax

MiniMax is project-only and runs `MiniMax-M3` through Remote's pinned Codex
app-server harness. It deliberately uses an isolated `/root/.minimax` home, so
its model catalog, sessions, and provider settings do not replace the normal
Codex account or `/root/.codex` state. This is runtime separation, not a
security boundary: container root can read every provider home mounted in that
project.

Configure MiniMax once for the Remote installation:

1. Open **Settings → Agents** and choose **Sign in with MiniMax** (or
   **Refresh MiniMax login** when replacing a key).
2. Follow the **Get a MiniMax Token Plan subscription key** link to subscribe,
   create, or retrieve the supported key from MiniMax. Remote does not link to
   the pay-as-you-go key console because standard API keys are not supported.
3. Paste the `sk-cp-…` key into the masked field and choose **Save API key**.
   Remote checks that it is a Token Plan key and validates it with MiniMax's
   subscription quota endpoint before storing it.
4. Return to a project chat and select **MiniMax** and **MiniMax-M3**.

Remote passes the key to the Codex process as an environment variable and
configures Codex to read that variable. It does not embed the key in the
generated model catalog or command-line configuration. The key is never
returned to the browser after saving. MiniMax is not offered for loose chats.
In project chats it stays visible as a locked **Sign in to use** provider, but
its model list remains unavailable until a validated key exists.

### Connect Kimi

1. Under **Kimi authentication**, start device login.
2. Open the verification URL.
3. Enter the displayed code.
4. Approve the account.
5. Return to Remote and wait for the connected state.

### Use Antigravity

Antigravity appears in both the chat provider picker and the administrator's
global **Agents** list. Its card is informational and marked provider-managed: the `agy` CLI does
not expose a host-wide sign-in flow that Remote can complete and distribute,
so Remote's supported sign-in workflow is project-local.

Sign in separately in each project:

1. Open a chat in the project.
2. Select **Open Terminal**.
3. Run `agy`.
4. Complete the URL-and-code flow displayed by Antigravity.
5. Exit the interactive CLI.
6. Return to the chat and choose **Refresh models** in the provider/model picker.
7. Select **Antigravity** and a discovered model.

That sign-in is shared with other users and agents inside the same project
container. Its files under `/root/.gemini/antigravity-cli` are a durable
provider-home mount. They survive ordinary stop/start and container
replacement; unrelated files elsewhere under `/root/.gemini` do not.

Remote cannot observe this terminal-based login, so it cannot invalidate the
model cache automatically. Use **Refresh models** after every Antigravity
sign-in or account change.

A loose chat can probe `agy` state that an operator configured directly on the
host, but Remote has no UI for establishing that state and its project Terminal
is unavailable to a loose chat. Use a project chat for normal Antigravity work.

Antigravity does not satisfy Remote's initial provider gate because Remote
cannot observe external auth authoritatively. A server administrator must still
connect one of the current gate-eligible modules: Claude, Codex, or Kimi.

### Shared-provider implications

- Every user and project shares the same host Claude, Codex, and Kimi accounts
  and their quotas.
- Those three provider credentials are copied into project credential
  locations.
- An agent that can read its project credential files can act with that provider authority.
- Claude, Codex, and Kimi homes are durable but separate by provider format, not separate security principals.
- Re-authentication can affect every project.
- Antigravity is project-local rather than host-wide, but its credential state
  is still readable by container root and shared by everyone with authority in
  that project.
- MiniMax runs only in projects, but its Token Plan subscription key is
  installation-wide and administrator-managed. It is injected into MiniMax
  runs and is subject to that MiniMax subscription's quota.

Non-admins can use connected providers but cannot connect or refresh them.

## Playbooks

**Settings → Playbooks** (administrators only) curates the one-click prompt
templates every chat composer offers behind the ⚡ button.

1. Select **Add playbook**, or edit an existing card.
2. Set the emoji, title, and a one-line hint — the hint is what users read in
   the menu.
3. Write the prompt. It may use `{{project}}`, `{{slug}}`, and
   `{{previewUrl}}`; any other placeholder is left for the user to fill in, and
   such a prompt is never sent automatically.
4. Optionally preselect **Skills**, and pin a **Mode** or **Provider**. Leaving
   either blank keeps whatever the chat is already set to.
5. Reorder with the arrows, then select **Save library**.

**Outcome:** the library is stored server-wide in `DATA_DIR/playbooks.json` and
every member sees the same entries immediately. A fresh install starts with
seven built-in playbooks; that seeding happens once and never overwrites your
edits. A skill a playbook names but this server has not published yet is
flagged on the card and starts working once the skill is installed. See
[Playbooks](../02-workspaces/13-playbooks.md).

## Users

Remote has one local password administrator. Additional users sign in through Google OAuth and must be registered before they can enter.

### Configure Google OAuth

Administrator steps:

1. Create an OAuth web client in Google Cloud.
2. Add the callback URL shown in **Settings → Users**.
3. Copy the Google client ID and client secret into Remote.
4. Save and confirm that Google sign-in is enabled.

The Google client secret is stored on the host in plaintext with restrictive file permissions.

> **Current authentication caveat:** Remote authorizes Google users by normalized email, does not check Google's `verified_email` claim, does not bind invitations to the immutable Google `sub`, and does not enforce a hosted-domain (`hd`) restriction. Treat invitations on custom domains with care and read the [threat model](../threat-model.md) before enabling multi-user access.

### Add a user

1. Open **Settings → Users**.
2. Enter the user's exact Google-account email.
3. Choose **member** or **admin**.
4. Choose **Add**.
5. Add a member to specific projects through each project's **Sharing** tab.

There is no public sign-up. A successful Google identity that is not in the user directory is denied.

### Change a role

Administrators can promote a member to admin or demote an invited admin to member.

- An **admin** can manage global providers, Google OAuth, users, all projects, resource limits, and deletion.
- A **member** sees only projects where their email is a member, plus any loose chats.

The local administrator cannot be removed or demoted. Remote also prevents removal or demotion of the final administrator.

### Remove a user

1. Find the user under **Users**.
2. Choose the remove action.
3. Confirm that access should end.

Removal blocks future authenticated requests for that email. Sessions are stateless 30-day tokens and have no individual revocation UI; deleting a user is the practical access-control lever.

## Resources

Administrators use **Resources** to set the CPU, memory, process, and disk
envelope every project container inherits, plus the memory held back for the
platform itself and the ceiling a per-project override may not pass. The panel
shows the host's real capacity, how much of it running workspaces already
commit, and whether the storage pool can enforce disk quotas at all. Saving
converges the managed LXD profile immediately. Full reference:
[Resource limits](../02-workspaces/11-resource-limits.md).

## Audit log

**Audit log** is admin-only. It lists what people did on this server, newest
first: sign-ins and sign-outs, project creation, renaming, and deletion,
membership changes, secret reads and writes, container starts and stops, agent
runs, scheduled-task changes, settings changes, self-updates, and workspace
file, terminal, and IDE access.

Each row shows the time, the actor, the action, the target, the caller's IP
address, and whether the action succeeded. Failed attempts are listed too, with
the reason.

To narrow the list:

1. Type an email in **Actor** to see one person's activity.
2. Type an action in **Action**. Matching is by prefix, so `project.` selects
   every project action and `project.secret.` only the secret ones.
3. Set **From** and **To** for a date range.
4. Choose **Apply filters**. **Clear** returns to the full list.

**Load older entries** pages further back. **Export** downloads the matching
date range as a JSONL file for archiving or offline analysis.

Entries are kept for a retention window the server operator configures
(twelve months by default), after which whole months are deleted. See
[Audit log](../04-operations/10-audit-log.md) for the entry format, the full
action list, and retention configuration.

Members see a notice instead of the table.

## Info

Use **Info** to inspect the parent host rather than one project container.

The page reports:

- current account email and role;
- server URL and collection time;
- CPU model, usage, load, and core counts;
- total, used, available, cached memory, and swap;
- filesystem mounts, capacity, used space, and free space;
- interfaces, addresses, and traffic counters;
- operating system, kernel, architecture, Go version, and uptime;
- backend PID, goroutines, file handles, heap, and system memory;
- configured application and storage paths.

Choose **Refresh** for a new point-in-time sample. These readings are operational observations, not performance guarantees.

## Sign out

Use the sign-out control in the account footer. This clears the platform session cookie from the browser. It does not disconnect host-wide agent-provider accounts.
