# Project settings

Open a project's settings with the gear icon beside its name in the sidebar. The page has four tabs: **Info**, **Settings**, **Secrets**, and **Sharing**.

![Project container information, agent versions, and credential-bundle state](/assets/docs/screenshots/01-project-container-info-00m37s.webp "The Info tab exposes the project computer rather than hiding it: runtime identity, tools, mounts, resources, network, and provider state are inspectable.")

## Info

Use **Info** to answer “what is actually running?”

The page can report:

- container state, type, image, architecture, PID, creation time, last use, and autostart;
- operating-system distribution, kernel, hostname, uptime, and CPU count;
- process count, CPU time, current and peak memory, swap, and disk usage;
- interfaces, IP addresses, traffic counters, MAC addresses, and MTU;
- workspace and provider-home mounts;
- installed Claude and Codex versions;
- agent instructions and credential-bundle freshness;
- effective CPU, memory, and root-disk limits.

Choose **Refresh** in the page header to collect a new snapshot.

### Repair project networking

Use **Repair network** when the container is running but has no usable IPv4 address or previews cannot reach it.

1. Open the project gear.
2. Select **Info**.
3. Find the network section.
4. Choose **Repair network**.
5. Refresh the page and confirm that a non-loopback address appears.

The host also runs a periodic IPv4 repair timer. Manual repair is the immediate recovery path.

## Settings

The **Settings** tab combines resource limits with project lifecycle controls.

### Set resource limits

Only an administrator can save project-specific limits.

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Read the **Resources** panel: the effective CPU, memory, and disk quota,
   whether each came from a project override or the fleet default, and usage
   bars showing what the container consumes against those limits.
3. Enter any overrides you need:
   - **CPU cores**;
   - **Memory**;
   - **Disk quota**.
4. Leave a field blank to inherit the fleet default. Each field shows the fleet
   maximum you cannot exceed.
5. Choose **Save limits**.

**Reset to defaults** removes the project overrides. CPU and memory apply live, and lowering memory can terminate container processes. A disk-quota change on a running container is recorded and takes effect on the next restart, which the panel says explicitly. A root-disk quota cannot be smaller than data already stored.

The fleet default envelope is set by an administrator in **Settings → Resources** and derived from this host's capacity on first run. The disk quota covers the container root disk only, not the durable workspace or provider-home bind mounts, and needs a storage pool that can enforce quotas — the panel says so when yours cannot. See [Resource limits](../02-workspaces/11-resource-limits.md).

### Start, stop, and force-restart

| Control | When to use it | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Start project** | The project is stopped, missing, or in error | Remote converges mounts and limits, starts or recreates the container, and runs launch provisioning. A start is refused when running containers would commit more memory than the host has; an administrator then sees **Start anyway (oversubscribe the host)** |
| **Stop project** | You want to release active compute | The container stops; durable workspace and provider homes remain |
| **Force restart** | A process is wedged or the project hit its limits | The host kills project processes and boots the container again |

Starting a missing project can recreate its container from the current base image. Files in `/workspace` and provider homes remain; ad-hoc root-filesystem changes do not.

### Delete a project

Only an administrator can delete a project.

1. Confirm that important work is committed and backed up.
2. Open **Settings**.
3. Choose **Delete project**.
4. Read the confirmation carefully and approve it.

Deletion removes the container, project metadata, project access list, secret store, durable workspace, and provider homes. Chat records are stored separately and the backend does not reliably cascade-delete every chat that referenced the project. Do not treat the sidebar confirmation as a backup or complete data-retention policy.

## Secrets

Use **Secrets** for project-scoped environment values such as API tokens, webhook secrets, JSON credentials, or PEM material.

### Add a secret

1. Open **Secrets**.
2. Enter a key such as `API_TOKEN`.
3. Enter the value. Multiline values are supported.
4. Choose **Add**.
5. Restart any already-running application that must read the new value.

Keys must match:

```text
[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*
```

### Reveal, edit, or delete

- Choose **show** or **hide** to control the visible value.
- Choose **edit**, change the value, then **Save**.
- Choose the delete icon and confirm to remove it.

### Where values go

The current backend:

- stores the authoritative secret file on the host in plaintext with mode `0600`;
- passes project secrets explicitly to agent runs, except that Codex clears or does not forward `OPENAI_API_KEY` so it uses subscription authentication;
- writes all values to managed `/workspace/.env` with mode `0600`;
- also puts single-line values into LXD `environment.KEY` for new inherited processes;
- omits multiline values from LXD config, while still passing them to agents and `.env`.

Propagation after a change is best-effort. A stale copy can remain after a partial failure, and an already-running process keeps its old environment. Restart affected processes and verify from inside the project.

> Project members can read, reveal, change, and delete project secrets. Agents can read them during execution. Sharing the project shares this authority.

The current Secrets UI contains older helper text claiming values never land in the container filesystem. That statement is no longer accurate; the behavior above reflects the current backend.

## Sharing

Use **Sharing** to decide which registered users can enter this project.

### Add a member

1. Ask an administrator to add the person's email in **Settings → Users** first.
2. Open the project gear.
3. Select **Sharing**.
4. Enter the exact registered email.
5. Choose **Add**.

The member can now use the project's chats, uploads, terminal, files, preview, Agent Browser, and secrets.

### Remove a member

1. Open **Sharing**.
2. Find the email.
3. Choose the remove icon.
4. Confirm removal.

Any current project member can add or remove registered members. A non-admin cannot remove the final project member. Administrators bypass the membership list and can recover access.
